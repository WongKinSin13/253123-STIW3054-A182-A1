Real Time Programming Assignment 1 Submission

Student are to develop a Java program to calculate software effort estimation. 
It will involved multiple calculation sections and some sections are linked together
(e.g scenario like value from calculation will be used in next calculation section). 

In order to simplify the process, the sections were break down to 8 parts. 
I tried my best to apply Object Oriented Programming concept in this task
and avoid "dirty and quick" procedural programming concept in this considerably simple program. 
Feel free to point out the flaws in my code and lets learn together. Thank you.
